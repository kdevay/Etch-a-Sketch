# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a webpage I created for The Odin Project. It is an etch-a-sketch emulator, which uses mouse swipes to draw images. 

In accordance with the Assignment's specifications, I created every element, besides the outermost container, using javascript.

The drawable area of the etch-a-sketch emulator is made up of a grid of divs. When users hover their mouse over a div, it changes from light to dark blue.

Clicking on the left dial beneath the drawable area will open a modal containing a slider which users can click and drag to adjust the grid's dimensions.
The range is 16x16 - 100x100, which amounts to 256 - 10,000 dynamically created divs for the drawable area alone.

Clicking on the right dial will open a modal with a small "about me" section, with a link to my github account.


ATTRIBUTIONS:
I used google's font api for the headings, github's "Inverted Octocat logo" to link my github account, and I learned to build modals and range slider with W3schools**.
